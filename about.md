# About Matt

Matt originally trained as a geologist (of sorts), then turned himself into a geophysicist (of sorts), and now is a scientific programmer based in Bergen, Norway. 

He works at Equinor, spending most of his time on tools in [their open-source software programme](https://github.com/equinor). Previously he led [Agile*](https://agilescientific.com/), a small scientific computing company that did all sorts of things in subsurface computing, especially training other geoscientists to use Python and machine learning methods. 

Before that he started a coworking space in Nova Scotia, and before that he worked at a variety of big companies doing geology and geophysics for cold, hard cash. 

You can get in touch at kwinkunks@gmail.com and find out what he's up to at this very website or over on [GitHub](https://github.com/kwinkunks).
